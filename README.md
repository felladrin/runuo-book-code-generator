## Introduction ##

RunUO Book Code Generator allows people to generate the code (C# script) of a book by simply filling out a form in the browser.

It comes with an optional PHP file that allows the generated code to be downloaded in .cs format. In this case you need to set the "temp" folder writable.

## Features ##

- Easily sets Book Title, Book Author, File Name and the Book Cover.
- Formats the contents of the book wisely, without wasting space.
- Checks if the file name has special characters or accents.
- Allows to change the book cover via image.
- Limits the book content to 60,000 characters, to avoid overflow.
- Allows to compress the code, if you don't intend to edit later.
- Commented javascript code, intended to be easy to understand.

## Usage ##

Download and unzip this package. Then, for single and offline use, open the index.html file with your favorite web browser. But to make it really useful, host it on a website and spread the link.

After generating the .cs file, put it anywhere in scripts folder, restart the server and use the command in-game: [add cbook

It'll show all the custom books generated by this script (if you didn't change the 'CBook' prefix, of course).
